# 🌌 Anoma Testnet Prototype
_A simple web3 prototype simulating the core functionalities of the Anoma Testnet._

<br />

### ✨ Core Idea

Anoma is not just another chain—it’s a network focused on **intents**. The core concept is to allow users to declare **what they want**, and the network will find the optimal way to fulfill that goal.

This prototype was built to provide an early feel of how a truly intent-centric user experience might feel in practice.

### 🚀 MVP Target

The current prototype in this repository successfully demonstrates:
- ✅ **Wallet Connection Flow**: Simulates a wallet connection and generates a mock address.
- ✅ **Token Balance Display**: Shows pre-defined balances for both **ANOMA** and **NAM** tokens.
- ✅ **Basic Transaction Flow**: Allows users to input a recipient address and amount to simulate a token transfer with live balance updates.
- ✅ **Design & Aesthetics**: Features a dark-themed UI with a unique grid background pattern and a minimalist design inspired by the Anoma ecosystem.

### 🔬 Why This Matters

Today's blockchain applications are often complex and difficult to navigate. This prototype serves as an initial step in imagining how interacting with a system like Anoma can be made simple and intuitive. It prioritizes the **user experience** over complex underlying technical details.
